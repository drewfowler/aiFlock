# aiFlock

A TUI for managing multiple AI coding agents from one dashboard.

## What It Does

Monitor all your AI coding sessions at a glance, see which ones need attention, jump in to help, and pop back to the overview. Like a tech manager visiting each engineer's desk.

## How It Works

1. **Create tasks** in the dashboard
2. **Start tasks** → spawns zellij tabs running Claude Code
3. **Status updates** via Claude Code hooks (WAITING/WORKING/DONE)
4. **Jump to** any session needing attention, then return to dashboard
